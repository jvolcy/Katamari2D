IDEAS

Perhaps the rats get bigger (faster?) when it eats the food.
Maybe you have multiple health monitors: Health (calls for eating veggies), Energy (calls for eating carbs) and Strength/Speed (calls for eating proteins).  Maybe strength reduces the impact of coming into contact with the Rats.  Or maybe proteins are some sort of power-up (gives you more speed, allows you to kill rats, etc.)

Maybe rats can change directions... especially if food appears behind them?
